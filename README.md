# Ember-guilded-rose

<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>
  This is an Ember intepretation of the <a href="http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/">Guilded Rose Kata</a>
  You're given a list of items on the screen, each with some special display logic.  You'll probably find some components that are doing
  too little, and some that are doing too much.  
</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>
    Refactor stuff! Try to balance eliminating duplication with readability and flexibility.
    What if the sales team decides to add 5 new item types? What if users want to remove
    items from the cart? Dream up some constraints and try them out.
</p>

<h4>Included Addons</h4>

<p>
  This app has both <a href="https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers">ember-truth-helpers</a> 
  and <a href="https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers">ember-composable-helpers</a> included to give you a range of helper choices.
